# June 22th: Part Sourcing!

I spent my whole morning putting together the component list for my speaker. I went with the Seed Xiao RP2040 as the microcontroller because it was the same thing used for my hackpad so I was used to its specs. Then I found parts on Amazon for the battery, the audio amplifier, and RGB lights to make my speaker look cool. Then I scavenged Ebay to find a bluetooth module. Then I found a boost converter but the actual part costs $1.50 but shipping is like $10! Pretty sure that shipping is the real price for the item and the price written is just to get people to buy it. I found some more connectors for my board and when I put the whole price together it came to around $70 bucks. However since the projects have a point scale of 4, 6, and 10, I was concerned as I thought this was a 4 and the 4 projects have a budget of $50. Luckily, when I asked in the Slack channel, an admin responded and told me that most custom projects default to 6 points and 4 points was for the hackpad. So I have a budget of $150 now! I wasnâ€™t originally planning it but, now I am going to add a touch responsive OLED screen to show what audio is playing and to skip the song or pause it and etcetera.
