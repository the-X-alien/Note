# Note
An open source speaker for all your music needs. Completed with dual speakers and bluetooth compatibility, this speaker is a great deal at just manufacturing price. Have the fun and get the brag rights of building your own speaker and get to keep a sweet final product. I made this project because I saw a picture of a speaker on the starter projects section but there was no guide on how to make a speaker, so I decided I make one myself.
